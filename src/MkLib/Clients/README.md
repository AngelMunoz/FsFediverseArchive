# MkLib.Clients

The `MkLib.Clients` namespace is meant to be consumed by client applications that will expose processed fediverse notes to the user.

As an Example the `MkDisplay` returns HTML that can be displayed in a browser and the `MkJsonify` function returns a JSON string that can be consumed by more general consumers e.g Desktop/Android/Web apps.
